            "General Information": "Male, 73 years old, farmer",
            "Chief Complaint": "Weakness in the left limb for 1 day.",
            "Present Illness": "The patient experienced weakness in the left limb at 10 a.m. today, which did not improve after bed rest. He was admitted for further diagnosis and treatment. Upon admission, he was able to stand and walk. Since the onset of this illness, there has been no headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, or visual disturbance during activities. No cough, sputum, or shortness of breath. No abdominal pain or diarrhea. On arrival, the patient was in good spirits and had a normal appetite. He reported dry stools and normal urination.",
            "Past Medical History": "Generally healthy; denies history of hepatitis, tuberculosis, or other infectious diseases. Diagnosed with upper esophageal cancer in November 2018 and treated with radiotherapy. Post-treatment, the patient resumed normal eating. History of hypertension for 5 years, with a maximum blood pressure of 180/110 mmHg. Takes 'Indapamide' and 'Nifedipine tablets' to control blood pressure. Denies history of heart disease, diabetes, other chronic diseases, surgeries, or trauma. Denies allergies to medications or food and any history of blood transfusions.",
            "Physical Examination": "Temperature: 36.9°C, Pulse: 108 bpm, Respiration: 22 breaths/min, Blood Pressure: 177/107 mmHg. Admitted to the ward with assistance. Conscious, fluent speech. Good memory, calculation, and comprehension abilities. Normal visual field and acuity. Normal ocular movement, no diplopia or nystagmus. Symmetrical facial sensation, no jaw deviation, no drooping of mouth corners. Symmetrical palpebral fissures, shallow left nasolabial fold. No dizziness or nausea. No choking on drinking water. Midline tongue protrusion. Left limb muscle strength: Grade 4, reduced touch and pain sensation. Negative bilateral Babinski signs. Negative meningismus signs: no neck stiffness, negative Kernig and Brudzinski signs.",
            "Auxiliary Examinations": "Immediate blood glucose: 8.4 mmol/L. ECG: sinus rhythm, normal electrical axis, abnormal T-wave. Cervical vascular ultrasound: atherosclerotic plaque formation in the right common carotid artery. Cranial CT: cerebral infarction adjacent to the right lateral ventricle. Cranial MRI: 1. Demyelination in the cerebral white matter. 2. Lacunar infarctions in the right basal ganglia, bilateral periventricular, parietal, and frontal lobes.",
            "Preliminary Diagnosis": "Cerebral infarction; Grade 3 hypertension (extremely high risk); Post-radiotherapy for esophageal cancer",
            "Diagnostic Basis": "1. History: Diagnosed with upper esophageal cancer in November 2018 and treated with radiotherapy. Hypertension for 5 years. Over 30 years of smoking history. 2. Symptoms: Weakness in the left limb for 1 day. 3. Signs: Blood pressure of 177/107 mmHg, left limb muscle strength Grade 4, reduced touch and pain sensation. 4. Auxiliary tests: Elevated immediate blood glucose, ECG with abnormal T-waves, carotid ultrasound, and cranial imaging consistent with cerebral infarction.",
            "Differential Diagnosis": "1. Cerebral hemorrhage: Typically presents with sudden headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, often with impaired consciousness and focal signs. CT shows high-density lesions. 2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Sudden headache, nausea, vomiting, positive meningeal signs, no limb paralysis. CT shows increased density in sulci and cisterns. 3. Intracranial space-occupying lesions: Progressive headache and vomiting with limb paralysis. CT/MRI confirms diagnosis.",
            "Course of Treatment": "Treatment included antiplatelet therapy, circulation improvement, blood pressure regulation, neuroprotection, statins, and acid suppression. After 2 weeks of hospitalization, the patient stabilized, and left limb weakness significantly improved.",
            "Final Diagnosis": "Cerebral infarction; Grade 3 hypertension (extremely high risk); Atherosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid artery; Post-radiotherapy for esophageal cancer",
            "Summary and Analysis": "Elderly male with a history of hypertension, esophageal cancer radiotherapy, and smoking. Sudden onset with localized signs confirmed cerebral infarction by cranial CT and MRI. Risk factors include hypertension and carotid artery atherosclerosis as evidenced by ultrasound. Artery-to-artery embolism is likely the cause. Treatment with antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure regulation, neuroprotection, and lipid stabilization resulted in improvement. Discharged with recommendations for a low-salt, low-fat diet, regular medication, moderate exercise, blood pressure monitoring, regular follow-up, and proactive secondary prevention."
